# Weather-Dashboard

## Description
This repository contains the code used to create and style a weather dashboard web application. Created with the avid traveler in mind, the weather dashboard is designed to allow the user to easily check the current weather and upcoming forecast of multiple cities at once.

### Technologies
Code is written with:
* html
* css
* javascript/ jQuery

APIs used:
* [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

### Features
Weather dashboard provides the user with:
* the target city's current weather conditions(temperature, humiditiy, windspeed, uvIndex)
* visual representations of the weather and color coded values for simple understanding
* a 5-day forecast prediction of the searched city
* a complete history of recently searched cities


### Functionality 
When run, the application will automatically populate the weather data of the city last searched. Using the search bar, the user can enter in the name of a city and the application will fetch the current weather conditions as well as the upcoming 5 day forecast of the specified location. Once a city has been searched, it will be displayed in the 'recent searches' history so that the user may easily flip through the data of multiple cities at once.
